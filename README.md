# Data Cleaning and Processing
The process of cleaning data in Power BI involves utilizing the Power Query Editor, an effective tool for shaping and modifying data prior to its loading into the Power BI data model. High levels of accuracy, consistency, quality, and integrity can all be attained with the aid of data cleaning. The insight obtained from data profiling indicates that the dataset used in this analysis is well-structured, consistent, and free of significant errors that might complicate analysis or interpretation. Each column has the correct data type assigned to it, the data values are accurate, and there are no duplicate records. Consistent naming conventions and uniform formatting are employed throughout the data.
As a result, no further cleaning is needed. The following process was carried out during data processes.


- **_Added a new column_**
  
The coffee sales data was enriched with six new columns: Year, Month Number, Month Names, Weekday, Week Number, and Quarter, which were added to the Maven Roastersâ€™ sales dataset. These additional columns are crucial in the analysis, enabling a detailed exploration of how Maven Roasters' sales have trended over time. They also play a significant role in identifying the busiest days of the week, helping to uncover the factors driving these patterns. By incorporating these temporal indicators, the dataset's analytical capabilities are enhanced, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of sales dynamics and patterns across different timeframes.

# Data Analysis and Insight
The primary goal of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights from Maven Roasters' sales data by thoroughly investigating key factors. First, it examines patterns in the data to understand temporal trends in sales over time. Second, a detailed analysis is conducted at the product level to identify the most and least frequently sold items, as well as the specific revenue contributions of each product. Third, the analysis explores the underlying factors influencing transaction volumes on specific days to determine which days of the week consistently see peak activity at Maven Roasters.

This analysis provides answers to the following questions.

**1.How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time?**

This analysis explores trends and changes in the sales performance of the coffee shop, Maven Roasters. It seeks to determine whether the sales have been steadily rising, falling, or fluctuating, in order to understand the overall trajectory of the companyâ€™s sales. A DAX (Data Analytics Expressions) measure was created to calculate the total revenue generated by the coffee shop each month. 

**DAX code for calculating Total Revenue.**
```
Total Revenue = SUMX ('Sales Data', 'Sales Data'[transaction_qty]*'Sales Data'[unit_price]) 
```

This measure compiles monthly sales data, providing a concise and comprehensive overview of Maven Roasters' revenue for each month. The insights gained from this calculation help identify trends, variations, and patterns in sales performance over time.
A line chart was used for the visualization to visually represent the dynamic patterns and fluctuations in sales data, providing a clearer and more insightful understanding of the changes within the dataset.


![](Revenue_Overtime1.png)  

From the above analysis,
- There is a consistent increase in total revenue from January to June, indicating a positive sales trend over the six-month period. 
- Revenue saw a significant rise from March to June, possibly due to seasonal factors or increased customer activity during this time. 
- June stands out with the highest revenue, suggesting a surge in sales or the success of promotions during that period.
  

**2.Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case?**

This involves analyzing the sales data to determine which days of the week the coffee shop experiences higher levels of business activity and to uncover potential reasons behind these patterns. To address this, the first step is to identify the busiest day of the week. The analysis required creating a measure to calculate the total revenue generated on each day. This was done by summing the sales amounts from all transactions, providing a quantitative measure of the financial impact for each day.

The chart below provided a clear visual representation of sales activity for each specific day. By identifying the day with the highest total revenue, it was revealed that Monday is the busiest weekday, generating the most revenue at $101.68k, followed closely by Friday with $101.37k. This indicates that Monday is the most profitable day for the business in terms of sales.

I conducted a follow-up analysis to identify which store locations generated the most revenue. Using the same methodology, I analyzed revenue trends across various store locations with a waterfall chart. Hell's Kitchen emerged as the top-performing store, generating $236.51k in sales, indicating a high level of customer activity. Lower Manhattan followed closely with $230.06k in revenue, while Astoria generated $232.24k.

**3.Which products are sold most and least often? Which drive the most revenue for the business?**

This analysis aims to understand the popularity and financial impact of different products on the coffee shop's overall performance. By identifying the top-selling, least-selling, and highest-revenue-generating products, the business can make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and potential promotions or adjustments to product offerings. A measure was created to calculate the total quantity sold for each product, and a bar chart was used as a visualization tool to display the results. To enhance clarity and highlight significant insights, a filter pane was applied to showcase only the top five best-selling products and the five least-selling products, based on quantity sold.

**DAX code for calculating Total Quantity**
```
Total Quantity = SUM('Sales Data'[transaction_qty])
```

# Top 5 Selling Product
![](Top_5_Product.png)

- With the highest quantity sold at 26,250 units, Brewed Chai Tea leads in sales, indicating that it is a customer favorite and a potential key revenue driver.
- Gourmet Brewed Coffee, Barista Espresso, Brewed Black Tea, and Hot Chocolate also have relatively high quantities sold, suggesting consistent demand across the board. Although these products are not the top sellers, their substantial sales indicate ongoing popularity and significant contributions to overall revenue.

# Least 5 Selling Product
![](Least_5_product.png)  

- With the lowest quantity sold at 221 units, clothing stands out as the least-performing product in terms of sales. 
- Organic chocolate, house blend beans, green tea, and green beans also show lower quantities sold, indicating reduced demand compared to other items.

# Best Selling Product by Revenue

This determination focuses on identifying products that contribute to the business's revenue. The analysis considers not only transaction frequency but also the interplay between product price and transaction quantity for each item, offering a comprehensive understanding of the key revenue drivers.
A measure was created to calculate the total revenue generated by each product, which was then used alongside a bar chart to visually represent the results. To streamline the presentation and emphasize key insights, a filter pane was employed to display only the top five best-selling products based on revenue. This approach provides a clear and focused view of product performance, facilitating strategic decision-making and actionable insights.

**DAX code for calculating Total Revenue**
```
Total Revenue = SUMX ('Sales Data','Sales Data'[transaction_qty]*'Sales Data'[unit_price])
```

![](Top_product_by_Revenue.png)    

- The products that generate the most revenue is Sustainably Grown Organic Large and Dark Chocolate Large, with Sustainably Grown Organic Large slightly leading with total revenue of $21,152. Although they do not generate the highest revenue, Morning Sunrise Chai Large, Cappuccino Large, and Latte Regular all show respectable revenue figures, indicating that they remain popular among consumers.
